Congratulations, you have just completed the Day 1: Deploying your first
Datcenter learning path!

In this learning path, we covered all the topics for deploying your first
datacenter. The guides in this path included production recommendations for:

- Reference architecture
- Deployment
- Backups
- Securing the datacenter
- Monitoring the datacenter health

These guides are a good start, however, gaining expertise with Consul requires a
deeper understanding of running a datacenter and hands-on experience. To gain
expertise, we recommend continuing with the _Day 2: Advanced Operations_ track
and reading the [documentation](https://consul.io/docs). The _Day 2: Advanced
Operations_ track will give you more oppurtunites to gain hands-on experience
with guided exercises.

Finally, we are including a [production readiness
checklist](/consul/advanced/day-1-operations/production-checklist) in the
appendix that can be used for deploying Consul. Note, this checklist is not an
exhaustive list and you may need to add additional items depending on your
environment.
